# clay-pigeon
An initial crack at trying to play the market using data science

## Overview
This project is written in python 3.8 in the PyCharm community edition, on the backbone of yFinance. If you do pull and try to execute, be certain of your dependencies before you hit the big green 'run' button. 

### Dependencies
- yFinance
- numpy
- pandas

Note there may be more dependencies, but I am not an expert in python and cannot list them for certain. If you are using PyCharm and would like a copy of the development environment, get in contact with me and I can get it to you - this will ensure you have all of the dependencies I am relying on.
